### Project Title 
🛒 Vrinda Store: Sales and Customer Analysis Excel Dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze online sales performance, customer behavior, and order trends for Vrinda Store, helping in making better business decisions.

### Short Description 
This dashboard helps in understanding how the store is performing across different months, states, platforms (like Myntra, Ajio), and customer segments (gender and age-wise). It was built to simplify decision-making using visual insights.

### Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and techniques:<br>
• 📊 Microsoft Excel – For building the entire dashboard<br>
• 📂 Pivot Tables and Charts – For summarizing and visualizing data<br>
• 🧠 Formulas Used – IF, VLOOKUP, CONCATENATE, TEXT, DATE, ROUND etc.<br>
• 🧹 Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates, handled blank cells, converted text to numbers/dates<br>
• 🎨 Conditional Formatting – Used to highlight key metrics<br>
• 📁 File Format – .xlsx for working file, .png for dashboard preview

### Data Source
Source: Raw sales data of Vrinda Store (provided in Excel)
The dataset includes:
• Order details (Order ID, Order Date, Order Status)<br>
• Customer info (ID, Gender, Age, State)<br>
• Product details (Type, Size, Platform)<br>
• Sales Amount and Quantity<br>

I cleaned and transformed this data using Excel formulas and PivotTables.

### Features
# Business Problem
It was difficult to track which month, platform, or customer type performed better without proper reporting. There was no clarity on which state or gender contributed more to sales.

• Monthly sales trends<br>
• Order status (delivered vs cancelled)<br>
• Top states by sales<br>
• Gender-wise performance<br>
• Platform/channel comparison<br>
• Age & Gender breakdown<br>
